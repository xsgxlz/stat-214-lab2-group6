# The project is complex and has many separate parts. So we do not have a single run.sh file because the project is too large to fit in a single run.sh file. Instead, we recommend the user to look at the individual modules and scripts in the project. In the code directory, we have 3 main directories: EDA, feature_engineering, and modeling. Each of these directories contains a README.md file that explains the purpose of the directory and how to run the scripts or notebooks in that directory.
