The **modeling** directory contains the code for the predictive modeling and post-hoc analysis of the models. The function of each file is as follows:

Autoencoder.py: Provides the Autoencoder code for training the model.

classification.py: Provides utility functions for classification tasks.

classification_*.ipynb: Search for the best hyperparameters for the corresponding classification model.

classification_eval_*.ipynb: Evaluate the corresponding classification model by using the best hyperparameters.

preprocessing.py: Provides utility functions for preprocessing the data.

preprocessing.ipynb: Preprocess the data and save the preprocessed data.

train_autoencoder.py: Train the Autoencoder model.

The train_autoencoder.sh script under the code directory is designed to run the train_autoencoder.py script with all the possible hyperparameters simultaneously.
